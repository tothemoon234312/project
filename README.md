      <h1>Online scammers increasing</h1>
      <div>
      </div>
      <p style="font-size:22px;">Online scams are rising quickly around the world, and experts are warning people to stay alert as scammers use more advanced tricks to steal personal information and money.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:22px;">According to recent reports, cybercriminals are creating fake websites, sending phishing emails, and pretending to be banks, delivery companies, or government officers. Their goal is to trick victims into giving away important information such as passwords, ID numbers, and bank details.</p>
      <p style="font-size:22px;">Because cybercrime is becoming widespread, we need to stay informed and aware of online threats.</p>

      <h1 style="max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto;">Why we need to stay informed</h1>
     
      <p style="font-size:22px;">Cybercrime is increasing every year, and anyone can be targeted — students, adults, the elderly, and even companies. Scammers usually focus on people who do not understand online dangers, which makes it easier for them to steal information or money.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:22px;">This is why it is important to understand how scams work, be able to recognize suspicious messages or fake websites, and protect our devices and personal information. We also need to think carefully before clicking any link or sharing any data online. By staying informed, we can reduce the risk of becoming a victim and help keep others safe as well.</p>
